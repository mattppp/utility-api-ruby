    # Public: Model representing a log entry. These are used as values for
    # modified and latest logs on several other objects, as well as in list form
    # for token usage histories.
    #
    # Attr: type [String] The log entry type. One of "updated", "error", or
    # "pending". Updated logs indicate a successfully finished task.
    # Errors::BaseError logs indicate a task that finished with an error.
    # Pending logs indicate that a task is still ongoing.
    #
    # Attr: timestamp [Time] The timestamp of the log entry.
    #
    # Attr: message [String] The message of the log entry. These may change, so
    # don't rely on their syntax.

      # Public: Initialize the Log object. The only thing different from the
      # BaseModel constructor is assigning 'type' to '!nil!' if it is not
      # present. This is done because the website API in some cases doesn't
      # return this field, but it is listed as a required one.
