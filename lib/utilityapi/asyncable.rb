module UtilityApi
  # Public: Mixin to support asynchronous execution of a class methods.
  # When included this adds async method which can be used to execute any other
  # method asynchronously.
  #
  # Examples
  #
  #   # assuming base is an instance of a class including this mixin
  #   # sequential execution of a method:
  #   value = base.get(uid)
  #   f(value) # process the value
  #
  #   # same method executed asynchronously, without callback:
  #   thread = base.async.get(uid)
  #   # ... other operations while the method is executed in the background ...
  #   value = thread.value # blocks until completed and raises errors, if any
  #   f(value)
  #
  #   # same method executed asynchronously, with callback:
  #   thread = base.async { |value| f(value) }.get(uid)
  #   # ... other operations while the method is executed in the background ...
  #   thread.join # blocks until completed and raises errors, if any
  #
  #   # using errback to handle errors:
  #   thread = base.async { |value| f(value) }.onerror! { |e| puts e }.get(uid)
  #   # ... other operations while the method is executed in the background ...
  #   thread.join # only blocks, no errors raised here
  module Asyncable
    # Public: Get an instance of AsyncHelper, which executes
    # any method of the base class in background.
    #
    # callback - Optional callback block, which will be called after a method
    #            is completed asynchronously.
    #
    # Returns AsyncHelper instance corresponding to this class.

  # Public: Helper class to perform methods asynchronously.
  # This can be instantiated directly, but it's easier to call async on a class
  # which supports asynchronous execution (and includes Asyncable mixin).
  # See Asyncable for more information and examples.

  # Attr: base [Object] The object which methods are to be run asynchronously.
  #
  # Attr: callback [Proc] The callback called after executing a method.

    # supports, but execute them asynchronously in a new Thread. This method
    # creates a new Thread, executes the base method there, then calls the
    # provided callbacks (if any) and sets the method return value as the Thread
    # value.
